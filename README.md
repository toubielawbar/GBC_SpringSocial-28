This repository contains the codebase for a Spring Social Web App with various capabilities including Inter-Service Communication, Friendship Service, API Gateway & Security Basics, Resilience & Monitoring, and Proper JPA Modeling.

Features
Inter-Service Communication
The application demonstrates the communication between different services within the Spring ecosystem. It utilizes RESTful APIs or message brokers for communication between microservices.

Friendship Service
The Friendship Service allows users to manage their connections, friendships, or social relationships within the application. Users can send, accept, or decline friend requests, view their friend list, and perform other related actions.

API Gateway & Security Basics
An API Gateway is implemented to manage and secure the application's APIs. It provides a single entry point for various microservices and includes security mechanisms such as authentication, authorization, and access control.

Resilience & Monitoring
The application incorporates resilience patterns such as circuit breakers, retries, and timeouts to ensure fault tolerance. Monitoring tools and logging are employed to track system behavior, performance, and errors.

Proper JPA Modeling
Java Persistence API (JPA) is utilized for proper modeling of entities and their relationships in the relational database. Entities are mapped correctly to database tables, ensuring data consistency and integrity.
